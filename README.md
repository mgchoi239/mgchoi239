# Min's Repo 👨‍💻

#### Hi my name is Min, and I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a major in Math and concentration in CS.

#### My current focus revolves around backend development and database management. In my two most recent internship experiences, I had the chance to contribute to the development of backend APIs (Samsung Electronics) and a end-to-end service (Addepar). These opportunities allowed me to broaden my expertise to encompass both backend systems and their associated database management.

#### I utilized this knowledge during my involvement in a mobile app development project, where I took on the role of a backend and database developer utilizing AWS Lambda. This experience enhanced my understanding of the design components between backend functionality and efficient database management. I am eager to delve deeper into the realm of data-intensive applications within these domains in my upcoming journey.
